      <p>Dear Andrés Jaque or Hiring Manager,</p>

      <p>I’m writing to you today to apply for the director role in the Making Studio. I actually started my journey as a maker at GSAPP about a decade ago. I was in my undergraduate degree at the time and thought I wanted to get an M.Arch so I joined the New York/Paris program for my junior year. I fell in love with making physical objects, so much so that I skipped architecture school and have been working continuously since then in some form of fabrication.</p>

      <p>Upon returning from Paris I went to work for Electroland, a firm specializing in <span class="info_tag" id="electroland" href="" data-okimage="assets/aurora_in_progress.jpg">large, interactive sculptures</span>. It was my role to translate the CAD models generated by the architects into manufacturable components. I’m currently working in a makerspace for a graduate program that sees many students coming from an architecture background. My primary contribution each day is helping them manifest the beautiful but impossible forms they design digitally.</p>

      <p>After Electroland I went on to work as a prop maker for Disney. There I learned a variety of techniques related to woodworking, moldmaking, metalwork, and finishing. The short deadlines forced me to adapt the fidelity of the props to their use cases. These techniques and time savers would allow me to help GSAPP students to ensure that their models clearly communicate their ideas while also minimizing the all-nighter masochism that architecture programs are infamous for.</p>

      <p>I then went on to work for the outdoor retailer REI to help them develop <span class="info_tag" id="bike" href="" data-okimage="assets/bike_preview.png">prototype bicycles</span> and improve their shop services. This was my first time managing and maintaining a professional machine shop. The skills I learned here would help me develop and document shop procedures for what I assume are mostly student employees at GSAPP’s Maker Studio.</p> 

      <p>Repairing and modifying the machines at REI got me interested in mechatronics, leading me to my current position as a master’s candidate in Technology Innovation with an emphasis in robotics from the University of Washington. I’m working as a crew member in our makerspace and as a designer/fabricator for a startup, <span class="info_tag" id="ally" data-okimage="asssets/bike_preview.png">Ally Robotics</span>. The skills I’ve learned here would let me assist students and faculty alike to bring their designs from the speculative to the real, developing novel fabrication techniques and machines that do not yet exist.</p>

      <p>The director position for GSAPP’s Maker Studio would allow me to synthesize my experience in fabrication, newfound skills in technology technology development, and passion for assisting others in a way that would be enriching to the student experience and foster new manufacturing possibilities.</p>

      <p>Thank you for your time and consideration,<br/>Jack Bowen</p>

        <p>Electroland was my first education in design for manufacturability and project management. Adding numbers and locating tabs to the back of the panels shown above meant that they could quickly find their home once they arrived on site. Solid communication between the assembly team and the water jet cutting company we were subcontracting ensured that we had the right flow of cut panels without overstressing the relatively small supplier we were working with.</p>

        <p>My time as a technical specialist at REI taught me how to manage a production environment shared by people across a wide range of technical skills. It tought me hard skills like how to re-wire a lathe but also soft skills such as how to add documentation to tool storage to minimize that tool's abuse.</p>

        <p>My current position at Ally Robotics has helped me upgrade my skills from one who uses and modifies fabrication tools to one who creates them. While much of this work is probably beyond the scope of the Maker Studio role, it would undoubtedly be beneficial in acting as an advisory role to students and staff who are looking to create next generation building systems and technology.</p>
